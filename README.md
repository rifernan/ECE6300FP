# ECE6300FP
Drawbot- Final Project for ECE6300
FPMain.m is the main MATLAB script for the final project. The following data files and functions are called in this script.
Image file pleaf.jpg is uploaded by FPMain.m.
Main file FPMain calls imCoordinates.m and invKin.m to process the image and compute the joint space respectively.
imCoordinates.m is a MATLAB function that computes the image paths and associated coordinates.  
invKin.m is a MATLAB function that computes the angles theta 1 and theta 2 for the paths coordinates found by imCoordinates.m
